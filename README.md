    "Algorithms are the poetry of logic â€” visualizing them reveals the beauty behind the code."



This project is a Sorting Algorithms Visualizer , designed to help students and beginners understand and observe how different sorting algorithms work in real time. It graphically represents sorting processes such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort, making it easier to grasp the step-by-step operations involved in arranging data.


ðŸŽ¯ Key Uses and Importance:

âœ… Educational Tool: Aids in learning Data Structures and Algorithms by providing visual feedback of how sorting techniques manipulate data.

âœ… Interactive Learning: Enhances user engagement through real-time animation and user-controlled speed adjustments.

âœ… Concept Clarity: Bridges the gap between code and algorithmic thinking by showing how arrays are sorted internally.

âœ… Web-based & Lightweight: No external libraries or installations required â€“ runs entirely in the browser.
